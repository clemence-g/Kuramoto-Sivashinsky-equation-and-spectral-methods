# Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Simulation 


> **Note:** This project was carried out with **Élodie Sorée** for the Numerical Simulation in Physics course at UCLouvain in 2024.

This project explores the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and its chaotic behavior. This equation describes the velocity dynamics of a fluid near a flame, with the system's behavior depending on the domain size.  

## Contents  

This repository includes two main code files:  

- **Animation of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky**: Generates an animation of the equation’s solution over time.  
- **Analysis of the Norm at Stationary State**: Computes and analyzes the norm of the solution in its stationary state.  

Additionally, a video file is provided to showcase the expected animation output from the code.
